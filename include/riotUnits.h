DESCRIPTION: destroyList() is used to deallocate memory for a UnitList struct.

ARGUMENTS: A Pointer to the UnitList to be destroyed.

POSTCONDITIONS: Each node listed within the UnitList is destroyed and the
 memory used for it is returned to the calling OS.*/


int getLength(struct UnitList *);/*

DESCRIPTION: getLength() is used to get the number of nodes containted within
 a UnitList.

ARGUMENTS: The UnitList to be examined.

POSTCONDITIONS: Will return a int value corresponding to the number of
 UnitNodes contained withing the UnitList*/

DESCRIPTION: isEmpty() is used to determine whether a UnitList has been
 initialized and is capable of storing UnitNodes.

ARGUMENTS: The UnitList to be examined.

PRECONDITIONS: The position is within the size of the list.

POSTCONDITIONS: Will return TRUE is empty, otherwide FALSE.*/


struct UnitNode *getHead(struct UnitList *);/*

DESCRIPTION: getHead() is used to get a pointer to the first UnitNode stored
 within the UnitList.

ARGUMENTS: The UnitList to be querried.

POSTCONDITIONS: Will return a pointer to the UnitNode, else NULL.*/


struct UnitNode *getTail(struct UnitList *);/*

DESCRIPTION: getTail() is used to get a pointer to the last UnitNode stored
 within the UnitList.

ARGUMENTS: The UnitList to be querried.

POSTCONDITIONS: Will return a pointer to the UnitNode, else NULL.*/

DESCRIPTION: enqueue() will store any data type (presumably either an Inmate
 or Guard type) at the back of a UnitList.

ARGUMENTS: The list to be extended and a pointer to the data to be added.

POSTCONDITIONS: Will store either the newly created UnitStore cointaing the
 unit within it's data member or NULL if not possible.*/

DESCRIPTION: dequeue() will remove the front UnitNode of the passed UnitList.
 Memory is not freed by this funtion-- either its returned UnitNode will need
 to be freed by rmUnit or enqueued in a seperate UnitList which can later be
 destroyed.

ARGUMENTS: The list to be modified.

POSTCONDITIONS: The front UnitNode is either removed from the passed UnitList
 and its pointer is returned, else NULL is returned.*/

DESCRIPTION: Removes the unit node at position.

ARGUMENTS: List to be removed from (struct UnitList *list).
           Position to be removed at (int position).

struct UnitNode *pop(struct UnitList *stack);/*

DESCRIPTION: pop() will remove the back UnitNode of the passed UnitList.
 Memory is not freed by this funtion-- either its returned UnitNode will need
 to be freed by rmUnit or enqueued in a seperate UnitList which can later be
 destroyed.

ARGUMENTS: The list to be modified.

POSTCONDITIONS: The back UnitNode is either removed from the passed UnitList
 and its pointer is returned, else NULL is returned.*/

DESCRIPTION: Creates an inmate and initializes it

ARGUMENTS: The inmate type to be assigned to the inmate that is being created (enum InmateType type);

void rmUnit(struct UnitNode* target);/*

DESCRIPTION: inmateRm() is used to remove a unit from the game.

ARGUMENTS: struct UnitNode *inmateList is the list of inmates present in
the game, this argument should be changed to a header node once one is
present.

PRECONDITIONS: The position is within the size of the list.

POSTCONDITIONS: The inmate at position has been removed.*/


struct Inmate *createInmate(enum InmateType type);/*

DESCRIPTION: createInmate() is used initialize a new inmate with its
 associated base stats.

ARGUMENTS: an InmateType enum associated with the Inmate to be initiated.

PRECONDITIONS: The enum value is a valid inmate type.

POSTCONDITIONS: Memory is allocated for a new Inmate struct.*/

DESCRIPTION: Returns a boolean based on if the inmate is within the guards range

ARGUMENTS: Size of the the map path horizontally (int rowSize).
