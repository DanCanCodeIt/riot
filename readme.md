## Game Overview

:hammer:RIOT! is a reverse tower defence game set in a prison theme.

It is a turn-based strategy game where the player is tasked with breaking out of correctional facilities by recruiting and deploying waves of inmates against statically positioned guards with the intention of generating panic and making their escape.

RIOT! intends to switch the roles of a traditional tower defence game, placing the user in control of what would conventionally be the enemy horde.
